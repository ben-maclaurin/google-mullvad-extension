I'd like to leverage the full range of privacy features provided by
the [[https://mullvad.net/en/browser][Mullvad Browser]] without being limited to DuckDuckGo. Although I
appreciate the privacy-focused options of DuckDuckGo and Mullvad Leta,
I occasionally require the search capabilities of google.com for
specific tasks, such as work-related research. The Mullvad Browser
does not currently offer an option to change the default search
engine. I've developed a small personal extension (intended solely for
my use) that redirects searches to Google.

/i know, probably a decision i'll one day regret/
